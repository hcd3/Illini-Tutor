    <string name="info_shit">IlliniTutor was created by Jake Elder and Hrishikesh Deshmukh, two Computer Science students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
        \n\nThis android app focuses on bringing together people who want to be tutored, and people who are willing to tutor, by allowing them to specify the subject, time, and
        location of the tutoring session. It aims to fill the large demand for tutoring generated by college students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
        By creating this app, we hoped to develop our personal Computer Science skills as well as satisfy an unfulfilled need on campus.\n\n
Click the button Find Your Tutor to create a new tutoring request or join existing requests.  Clicking on create new request will allow you to enter your information.
        Type in your name, phone number, course, and location into the first text box (separated by commas).  Proceed to type in the desired date, time, number of people,
        and whether or not you would be willing to have other people join or not (open v.s. closed).  Then click on Create Request.  You can proceed to view your tutoring
        request as well as other requests by clicking Go To List.\n\nTo tutor other people, click I\'m a Tutor.  This will take you directly to the list where you can search
        for a session you would be willing to tutor, and then proceed to contact the individual who created the request.\n\nThank you for using our app!
